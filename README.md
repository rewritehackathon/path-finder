# Overview: 
This solution can be applied to any Insurance line of business like **Auto, Property, Cargo, Agri, etc** with minor tweaks.
We have used Auto insurance as an example to present our solution.

# Solution:

**Connected CAR** – An **IOT** device tracks the driving patterns of the driver constantly. Using **AI/ML** the car alerts the driver to PREVENT an Accident, considering factual and predicted data in terms of driving patters, weather, Geo-code for accident prone areas and also it sends data for analysis to **block chain Data Lake**. It also alerts the driver on the mobile app when the driver is not near the car incase of a hit and run or theft with real time data connected to block chain. The IOT device captures 360 degree view pictures for factual data for smart payment of claims.

**Claim-Less Future** – Using the IOT device in the connected world, the CAR can send signals to alert for help, inform the insurance company in case of an accident. The pressure pad on the cars will determine the frequency and impact of the accident for accurate claim reimbursement while the IOT device will send pictures of the damage. This will lead to a painless claim reimbursement process for the customer and the insurance company.
